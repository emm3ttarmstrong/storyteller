Design a modern, minimal, editorial-grade web application UI for a desktop-first interactive storytelling tool.

Overall Vibe

Clean, confident, quietly expressive

More literary / creative tool than “AI dashboard”

No visible “AI chrome” (no sparkles, robots, gradients screaming “AI”)

Feels like a cross between:

a high-end writing app

a modern narrative game UI

an editorial publishing tool

Avoid anything that feels:

Bootstrap

Material UI

Notion-clone

ChatGPT-like

Over-rounded, bubbly, or playful

Layout & Structure

Three-panel layout (but visually light):

Center column — Story Flow

Chat-like vertical flow of scenes

Each scene appears as a refined “story card”

Text-forward, generous line height

Clear visual separation between scenes without heavy borders

After each scene:

2–4 “What happens next?” options as clean text buttons

A subtle “Custom choice…” input

Right panel — Canon & Changes

Collapsible panel

Two sections:

Current Canon (character cards with attributes)

Proposed Changes (diff-style: before → after)

Accept / Reject actions are minimal, icon-driven, deliberate

No tables, no checkboxes unless absolutely necessary

Top navigation

Very minimal

Story title on the left

Breadcrumb / “Jump to scene” control

No heavy nav bars

Typography (very important)

Primary font: modern serif or high-end humanist sans

Examples to emulate (not necessarily copy):

Editorial serif for story text

Clean grotesk or humanist sans for UI

Story text should feel publishable

Large, readable body text

Subtle typographic hierarchy (not loud headings)

Color Palette (Unique, non-AI)

Avoid:

Neon gradients

Purple-blue AI palettes

High-contrast black/white only

Suggested palette direction:

Deep charcoal or ink-black background accents (not pure black)

Warm off-white or parchment-like main background

One muted but distinctive accent color:

oxidized copper

desaturated teal

muted plum

dusty amber

Secondary accent for status:

soft sage (accepted)

muted rust (rejected)

Colors should feel literary, cinematic, and timeless

Use color sparingly — mostly monochrome with intentional accents.

Interaction Design

Subtle hover states

No aggressive animations

Small motion only where it adds clarity (e.g., expanding proposed changes)

Buttons feel intentional, not “CTA-y”

Icons are thin, precise, and minimal

Tone & Personality

The interface should feel:

Calm

Trustworthy

Focused

Like a tool used by someone serious about storytelling

It should get out of the way of the words.

Explicit “Do Not Do”

No chat bubbles

No assistant avatars

No glowing buttons

No emoji

No fake terminal styling

No “AI assistant” language in the UI

Deliverable

Design one primary screen showing:

An active story with 2–3 scenes

Choice options visible

Canon panel open with at least one proposed change shown

Clear hierarchy, spacing, and typographic rhythm

If you want, next I can:

Translate this into Tailwind design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)

Propose exact font pairings

Sketch component names so design maps cleanly to React components
